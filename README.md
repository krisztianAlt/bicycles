# Bicycle Spider

This is a data extraction project that I wanted to practice web crawling and scraping. The program collects data on city bikes from BikePro's website (https://bikepro.hu/), and displays it in the browser (https://bicycles.herokuapp.com/).

The project gave me the opportunity to practice the back-end development in Node.js and the recursive use of Javascript promises.
